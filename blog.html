                    <a class="blogTitle" href="#">I was assigned a task to create my own Portfolio. Here's how it
                        went!</a>
                    <p>I was very looking forward to this. Infact, I even brainstormed a few ideas of potential
                        Portfolio websites that I can make. Not only did it seem like a fun task but also the fact that
                        this is something that I can easy update use for myself in the future when I leave university to
                        get a real job in industry, was a very good thing to be in control of. And so I set my best foot
                        forward, and pooled together the culmination of information that I learnt over the past couple
                        of weeks. This helped me to create an initial design draft of my Portfolio. I thought that it
                        was going great until I hit a thought occur to me that the direction I was going on was gonna
                        make me soon hit a wall. And a wall I hit very soon, where I tried to redesign the initial
                        navigation bar so that it would be coupled with animations but the animations would not work
                        becuase of other css rules which I had embedded throughout the website. Simultaneously, I
                        couldn't add a background animaiton to my website because of this hindrance. As a result, I
                        scrapped the first draft and made a second Portfolio.

                    <a class="blogTitle" href="#">The Second Iteration Of My Portfolio!</a>
                    <p>I had a chance to reflect on the progress that I had made with my firt draft and figured out
                        where I was going wrong and what I had to do to break through the "wall" that I hit. This second
                        version that I started from scratch actually came about to being a real thing becuse I remember
                        my lecturer saying that more so than often, it is a much better idea to start from scratch and
                        continuosly improve the product than be stuck on an initial idea which could be a massive
                        hindrance on my progress. This second version of my Portfolio is a very big upgrade over the
                        first version as I have successfully been able to implement an animated background. other
                        features I have been able to throw into the Portfolio are things like a modern and responsive
                        contact form, a very unique portfolio page that offers intuitive information boxes. Furthermore,
                        as a result of being able to create a fresh version, I was able to fully implement git into my
                        project so that I have a very comprehensive version control tracking all chnages and keeping
                        copies of the entire project accessible to multiple parties on request.

                    <a class="blogTitle" href="#">Spearheading final chnage into my Portfolio</a>
                    <p>I have hit my head manytimes on the ceiling before having to conduct extensive research to break
                        through. Some of the research was into animations. Infact, a huge chucnk of my time reasearching
                        was
                        into animations and how I can implement them into my project in the form of an animated
                        background
                        or as text that chnages colour if I hover over it. The more time I spent toying around with HTML
                        and
                        CSS, the more I understood how it works and how I can use different things for different
                        purposes
                        such as margins, padding and more advanced things like grid and flex displays. making the blog
                        page
                        was no piece of cake either, with me having to sit down and spend hours upon hours of trrying
                        different things till I found the format I liked, which made it look somewhat like a real blog
                        page
                        on a real blog website. After the blog psge, the only page that was left to be made was the
                        sitereport. This is arguably the most important page on the website as it is where I have to
                        write
                        my report on how I made the website and show the validation for the HTML and CSS code that I
                        wrote
                        to make the Portfolio.
